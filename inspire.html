        <h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
        <p>A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.</p>
        <p>J.C> Leyendecker is a very inspiring figure and hero to me, as he was such a brilliant artist and his courage as a gay man in the early 20th century is admirable. His artistic style and success not only shaped illustration in America, but also paved the way for future generations of LGBTQ+ artists.</p>
